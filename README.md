# famly-fetch
Fetch your (kid's) images from famly.co

You need python3 installed and then it's as simple as running:

```
./fetch-famly <email> <password>
```

Notice that this will make your password visible in the process list
while the program is running, so only run this on a personal computer.

Downloaded images will be stored in the current working directory,
usually the folder where you run this program from.
